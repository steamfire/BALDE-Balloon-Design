# BALDE-Balloon-Design
Zero Pressure Balloon design program in (assumed to be) FORTRAN IVX, orig by James Rand, 1978

Adapted to run on the [CDC 6500 mainframe in FORTRAN IV Extended at Living Computer Museum](https://wiki.livingcomputers.org/doku.php?id=cdc6500_survival_guide).  The computer is remotely 
terminal accessible via the link, where the code can be run.

    C                       BALLOON DESIGN PROGRAM
    C*******************************************************************
    C  THIS PROGRAM CALCULATES THE SHAPE OF A FREE BALLOON GIVEN A SET UP 
    C  INPUT CONDITIONS. IT IS FOR FULLY TAILORED BALLOONS ONLY, WITH OR
    C  WITHOUT AN ENDCAP. CONVERGENCE OF THE SOLUTION IS OBTAINED BY 
    C  MATCHING THE TOP LOAD REACTION TO THE TOP LOAD. THIS PROGRAM
    C  INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF THE LOAD TAPES IN THE CALCULATIONS.
    C*******************************************************************
    C  THIS PROGRAM IS BASED ON THE PROGRAMS "BALLOON" AND "FLATEALL",
    C  AFCRL-65-92. “DETERMINATION OF THE SHAPE OF A FREE BALLOON", BY
    C  J. H. SMALLEY.
